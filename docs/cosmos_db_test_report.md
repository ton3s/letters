# Cosmos DB Integration Test Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the comprehensive testing performed on the Cosmos DB integration in the insurance letters application.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Unit Tests (13 tests - All Passed)
The unit test suite (`tests/test_cosmos_service.py`) covers all methods in the `CosmosService` class:

#### Core Functionality Tests:
- **Health Check**: Tested both successful connection and failure scenarios
- **Save Letter**: Tested successful save with auto-generated fields
- **Get Letter**: Tested successful retrieval and not-found scenarios
- **Query Operations**:
  - Get letters by customer
  - Get letters by type
  - Get recent letters
- **Update Letter Status**: Tested successful status updates
- **Delete Letter**: Tested soft delete functionality

#### Edge Cases:
- Handling when container is not initialized
- Error handling for missing letters
- Proper exception handling for Cosmos DB errors

### 2. Integration Tests
- Full letter lifecycle test (create, read, update, delete)
- Skipped when Cosmos DB credentials are not available

### 3. Manual Testing
Successfully tested against the actual Azure Cosmos DB instance:

#### Connection Details:
- **Endpoint**: https://teamly-cosmos-serverless.documents.azure.com:443/
- **Database**: insurance_letters
- **Container**: letters
- **Partition Key**: /type

#### Test Results:
- ✓ Health check: Connection successful
- ✓ Create: Letter saved with ID e40d697d-4165-4f12-a6a5-d4228db0baf7
- ✓ Read: Letter retrieved successfully
- ✓ Query by customer: Found letters for 'Test Customer'
- ✓ Query by type: Found letters of type 'test_type'
- ✓ Recent letters: Retrieved 3 most recent letters
- ✓ Update: Status changed from 'pending' to 'approved'
- ✓ Delete: Soft delete implemented correctly

## Key Features Verified

### 1. Document Structure
Letters are stored with the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "type": "letter",
  "customer_name": "Customer Name",
  "policy_number": "POL123",
  "letter_type": "renewal/claim/etc",
  "content": "Letter content",
  "prompt": "Original prompt",
  "compliance_status": "pending/approved/rejected",
  "created_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "updated_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "deleted": false,
  "deleted_at": "ISO timestamp (when deleted)"
}
```

### 2. Query Capabilities
- Cross-partition queries enabled for flexible data retrieval
- Queries optimized with proper indexing
- Support for filtering by customer, type, and date

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing documents
- Proper exception handling for Cosmos DB errors
- Fallback behavior when container is not initialized

### 4. Soft Delete Implementation
- Letters are marked as deleted rather than physically removed
- Allows for data recovery and audit trails
- Deleted letters remain queryable for compliance

## Performance Observations
- All operations completed within expected timeframes
- Queries return results efficiently
- No timeout issues observed

## Recommendations
1. **Monitoring**: Implement application insights for production monitoring
2. **Backup**: Ensure Cosmos DB backup policies are configured
3. **Indexing**: Review and optimize indexing policies based on query patterns
4. **Retry Logic**: Consider implementing retry logic for transient failures

## Conclusion
The Cosmos DB integration is fully functional and ready for production use. All CRUD operations work as expected, error handling is robust, and the soft delete implementation provides good data governance capabilities.
